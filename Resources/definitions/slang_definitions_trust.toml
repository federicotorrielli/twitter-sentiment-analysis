amc = "American Motors Corportation - was created by the merger of the Hudson and Nash motor companies in 1953. At the time it was the biggest merger in US history. By 1960 both the Hudson and Nash names were phased out and the company product was known simply as \"[Rambler]\". By 1969 the Rambler name was phased out and all cars were simply known as AMC. \r\n\r\nAMC became famous for its line of enconomy cars, but made some critical mistakes that caused the company to lose  millions and be sold to Chrysler in 1986. The first one was [the Marlin], designed as [AMC's] answer to Ford's Mustang in 1964. But management decided to build it on a [large car] frame, which made it bigger and more expensive than the Mustang, and not as quick or economical for teenagers and young adults. [The Marlin] was a poor seller, but was a extremly good looking car and now very collectable. \r\n\r\nIn 1968 AMC rolled out [the Javelin], which was the best car AMC ever built. Sleek, sexy and powerful it gave the Mustang, Camero, Firebird, Charger and Barracuda a big run for thier money and at the [dragstrip]. It lasted until 1974 when it was dropped from the lineup and replaced the poor selling (and ugly) [Madador] coupe. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970's you could call AMC the \"Alternative Motor Company\" - they put out some of the strangest American cars ever built. The first one was the Gremlin, which was basically a AMC Hornet with the back cut off and replaced with a hatchback. With a [light body] it was a very quick, fun and responsive car, even with an [straight 6] motor. It was a fun ponycar challenger with the optional and rare V-8 option.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 AMC rolled out which must be the strangest car ever and the one they're known in pop culture history for - [The Pacer]. This car was as wide as a full size auto but as short as subcompact with lots of glass. Once you saw it, you never forgot it. The Pacer sold briskly in the mid 70's but sales fell off quickly by the late 70's when people became tired of the looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 AMC released The Eagle - essentully a AMC Hornet/Concord wagon with 4 wheel drive. Some car/truck historians say this was the first true SUV. It lasted until 1988.\r\n\r\nIn the early 80's AMC was almost bankrupt. The company had wasted most of its cash on [the Matador] Coupe and [Pacer] and had no money to upgrade its aging line of cars. A buyout from French automaker [Renault] proved disasterous for AMC with bad quality economy cars that sold poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing that was keeping AMC alive was its Jeep line, which they bought in the 1960's. In 1983 they downsised [the Cherokee], making it lighter and smaller. It became AMC's best selling product in the 1980's and remained in the lineup until 1991 when Chrysler replaced it with the [Jeep Liberty].\r\n\r\nIn 1986 Chrysler Corporation bought AMC.\r\n\r\nThe only things from the AMC legacy still around are the classic Jeep Wrangler, and it's legendary 4.0 \"power tech\" Straight-6. This is not a modern engine by any means. It was designed in 1964 for the AMC Rambler and still being made today in [Kenosha] WI at the original AMC factory, built in 1919!\r\n\r\nThough AMC is now history, the [marquee] is still fondly remembered by car collectors and fans. Cars that were once considered \"junk\" have now become cool and highly collectable."

Males are the most common specimens found in pet stores, and are brightly colored with long fins.  Females, once nearly impossible to find by non-breeders, have been trickling into pet stores for sale, though at first glance female bettas may be mistaken for a completely different species of fish. Females are the same size as male betta, often lack the same bright colors and never have the large amount of finnage that males have.\r\n\r\nBettas do not require airation in their tanks. The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice [paddies] and ditches.  \r\n\r\nBettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high [protein diet] in order to survive.  Special betta food is needed for them to live, but to thrive they *need* to be fed on live foods, such as mosquito larvae, bloodworms, small [fruit flies], and fruit fly maggots.\r\n\r\nMales of this species are naturally competitive and agressive towards one another.

kohls = "An establishment located in plazas and sometimes traditional malls. Mr.[Kohl] \"pioneered\" a method where the registers are at the front like a grocery store but since then this technique has ineffective because current management believes that having only one worker on the registers is sufficient. Because of their lack of insight this leads to a constant \"[barrage] of backup to mens!\", \"backup to womans!\", \"There is no line at jewelry!\",etc over the [intercom].Most of the time even despite the lack of workers at [the register] the reason for the hold up at the register is because of the employees who participate in long drawn out conversations with customers about the great \"deals\" they have. The main reason  for the delays at the register, however; is due to the company's credit policy. Each Manager is bred and trained into credit \"whores\" where their main existence is to bully and [pester] customers into signing up for credit cards where they charge a fee of 20% if your late on your payment.$100, you pay $120. If the customer says [no they don't] want a credit card in the manual an employee supposed to say, \"Are you sure you have an opportunity to save up to 12 times a year\" and if that doesn't work in a desperation move an employee is then supposed to ask if they would like to sign up for an email account. Kohls prides itself in a [yes we can]! policy i.e. if you bring a shirt to the register and say its 20 bucks but [on the register] it says the actual price is 30 they are supposed to give it to you for 20. Actually because the people working at the registers believe they have some divine duty to not give anyone a deal add to the increased barrage of people on the intercom by calling for employees to see if that is the actual price. Continuing their [credit whore] policy it is common for a manager to go on the intercom and plea for customers to sign up for a credit card and describing the \"benefits\", these can last up to 3 minutes. Even though the sounds emitting over the intercom can sound like [nails on a chalkboard] some would argue that its a better then the atrocious music that plays such favorites as \"All in this Together\" - Ben LeeOne day on an 8 hour shift this song played a total of three times inducing nausea.Kohls attempts to justify their credit whoring by saying that it benefits everyone including employees because each employee receives a [meager] [stock option] after a year of employment and it will help increase that value;however, most employees don't even survive their 90 day training period let alone a year. An employee also only receives an increase of 50 cents to their paycheck for each credit card [whored]. The job pays bad especially in comparison to other similar retail establishments in the same class some even offer commission. Every Kohls is always understaffedgranted a lot of employees quit this shortage leads to a lack of customer service and a [pigpen] of a store. To add salt to the wound every week their is a customer service report card and the common complaint is lack of available associates, The managers then manipulate this [statistic] by putting the blame on employees saying they are not wearing their name badge or they don't smile and say hi to each customer. [Kohl's] does however offer cheap merchandise albeit at the expense of its employees so it is a good place to find a deal.[That being said] as an employee the workplace at Kohl's left me with a pessimistic outlook on life and since my termination from the company i feel like a changed individual.Oftentimes [work experience] will help you become a better worker but Kohls has managed to put me in a worse position then before i started.

As work at a [drive-in] was deemed strenuous and unpleasant (even for drug-out hippies!!) theatres of this nature were often forced to hire from the “untouchable” caste of American society.  (This included ex-cons, street mimes, demented clowns, and certain types of super intelligent [marsupials].)  \r\nPeople used to have an abundant amount of sex at a drive-in.  This was due to the fact that, in the 1970s, it was thought that parents conceiving an infant during a drive-in feature would be granted immortality and a free [betamax] copy of [In Like Flint].  How this urban legend was started is unknown, but one would assume it had something to do with the massive amounts of LSD consumed by hippy stoners of the 1970s.  \r\n[Drive-in] movie theatres are now all gone, due mainly to the Hippy Massacre of 1986, which resulted in the genocide of many hippies, including Lance Armstrong’s [third cousin] “Larry Cletus Smokealotofpot”.  Also, employees of drive-ins often burned parts of their workplace to [cinders] while performing bizarre pagan rituals.  \r\nIn conclusion, [Joan Rivers] is hot and I would gladly have carnal relations with her [pruny] exoskeleton.\r\n"

montclair = "Commuter suburb in [Essex County], NJ, about 15 miles from Manhattan. Divided into about three sections. [Section 1]: The \"ghetto\" of southeastern and east central Montclair, mostly composed of vaguely derelict multifamily houses and vacant laundromats, and black with a few Sikhs in population. Known as an infamous drug trading area for everyone in suburban Essex County. The area between [Glenfield] Park and [Glen Ridge] Avenue is typically considered the worst area, where over 1/2 the businesses are vacant and most of the houses appear to be in a state of disrepair. It is also home to [Lackawanna] Plaza, a discount shopping center. Black people have lived in the area south of [Bloomfield] Avenue in East Montclair since the 1700s, and the area north of Bloomfield Avenue is originally a very old Italian neighborhood that is now primarily black, but with some Sikhs. 2. Downtown Montclair-An expanding area centered on the fairly trendy business area around Bloomfield Avenue, Church Street, Fullerton Avenue, Midland Avenue, and Walnut Street. [This is home] to many boutiques, restaurants, [art house] movie theaters, bookstores, galleries, and a disordinate number of antique stores for such a small town. The residential areas of Downtown Montclair range from primarily white luxury apartments and restored Victorian two-family houses off Bloomfield Avenue to multimillion dollar houses near Essex Park and down South Mountain Avenue towards the Eagle Rock Reservation. Upper Mountain Avenue in the vicinity of Downtown Montclair is the home of the wealthiest part of Upper Mountain Avenue, which offers multimillion dollar mansions and NYC views, and is arguably the most exclusive street in suburban Essex County. Downtown Montclair has spawned a breed of white rich kids who think of themselves as the hippest, hottest thing in the universe. Most of the people who are Downtown Montclair users are either yuppies, part of an expat community of twenty, thirty, and fortysomethings from NYC, or bored, self-absorbed teenagers. Downtown Montclair also includes most of Claremont Avenue, a somewhat dangerous and deserted residential boulevard. Home of [Montclair High School], infamous as home of racial rioting and rich white indie kids. 3. Upper Montclair-The very, very wealthy, totally white and primarily residential area north of [Watchung] Avenue. Known as the home of private high schools like Lacordaire Academy and [Montclair Kimberley Academy], both used by Upper Montclair residents and residents from towns to the west. Upper Montclair is very middle-aged white and [teenagery] and totally boring and quaint. The main business strip is Valley Road, [seconded] by Watchung Avenue. People from Downtown Montclair view it as the epitome of the rich white people who they think they aren't, even though Upper Montclair people do happen to be sheltered, obnoxious, and when not old money, act like they're old money. Montclair is, finally, known for the attitude of thinking itself diverse (by the white people) but being, in actuality, totally segregated, even among the black people. The wealthier blacks live towards [West Orange] while the poorest towards Glenfield Park. It's an ideal example of the hypocritical secret racism by white liberals on a smaller scale, as opposed to the occurence in NYC, which is on too large a scale to thoroughly socially examine."

7-11 = "7-11 is the historical name ascribed to the most prevalent naturally occuring [inconvenience store]. Known since antiquity, 7-11 has become the world's foremost purveyor of toxically unhealthy processed food products. Also notable are the [frictionless] tile floors and the uniformly East Indian service staff.\r\n\r\n7-11 has been a recognized natural phenomenon since the dawn of recorded history.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the 7-11 was a natural evolution of the 7-10, a prehistoric herd animal. 7-10 were common when the entire [landmass] of Earth was concentrated into one [supercontinent], [Pangaea]. Herds of 7-10 freely roamed the continent, having only one natural predator - [the Chuck Norris]. The massive evolutionary strain induced by such a [formidable foe] necessitated a new evolutionary strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first 7-11 was created by a confluence of the superintelligent East Indians and a herd of 7-10. This new symbiotic strategy proved successful - so successful, in fact, that individual members could survive without the protection of the herd. 7-11 spread to every corner of the supercontinent before the famed breakup of Pangaea (actually caused by one of Chuck Norris' temper tantrums) and so were located around the planet when humans showed up some hundreds of millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 7-11 on humanity has been tremendous. Former hunter/gatherer societies, upon finding a cluster of 7-11, would settle there rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle. With the relief of the burden of constantly searching for food, humans were free to develop other primitive activities, such as religion and the killing of innocent people. It is at this point in history that we see the first evidence of Norris worship, including human sacrifice and execution by roundhouse kicking. The first cities developed around herds of 7-11, and wars were common between those who had access to 7-11 and those who did not have such privilege.\r\n"

Think gelled hair, Armani Exchange, fake tans and heavy make-up. Easy to confuse for imports from New Jersey.\r\n\r\nHollywood Rich- Much of the northern tier of the county, which is more rustic, appealing to celebrities seeking privacy. Bedford, [North Salem], Pound Ridge and others boast several celebrity residents.\r\n\r\nGhetto- The last type of community one would associate with Westchester. Still, cities like Yonkers, Mount Vernon, (parts of) New Rochelle and Peekskille are far more socioeconomically and racially diverse than the rest of the county and make up a substantial portion of its population,  "

Vallejo started mainly as a spanish and native american city, then grew intensely over the years.

Some of the dangerous parts of the city are: [Millerville], South Vallejo, Country Club Crest, Downtown-west, [Hillcrest] area among many other small parts, this is where there are stronger concentrations of crime.  \r\n\r\nVallejo in 1987 at a population of 70,000 had 34 murders which was the record number for the city.  For a city of approx. 450,000 people(Oakland, Ca) that would be approx. [204] murders which by far exceeds [Oakland's] highest homicide rate of [190]. Vallejo has  claimed by many to \"become the next \"Richmond\" or \"Oakland\" which it already has been, but has made dramatic improvements.  Many of the new residents of Vallejo do not know the history and cannot appreciate how far Vallejo has come.  It was the Oakland or the Richmond of it's day and has dramatically improved over the years to homicide rates of 3 per year with a population of over 120,000 people.  Other crimes such as thefts and burglaries are far above average, but overall the city has improved becoming a safer place to live.\r\n\r\nVallejo is the home of musicians: Sly and the [family Stone], Mac Dre, [E 40], [Mac Mall], [Turf Talk].\r\n\r\nVallejo is also the home for [Six Flags] Discovery Kingdom formerly known as Six Flags Marine World.  Vallejo is increasing in size, and the economy is growing, more jobs are created to keep more people off the streets.  \r\n\r\nVallejo is well known for the many churches it has, and is the backbone to gospel music in the Bay area along with Oakland, Ca.  Also performing here as one of the top organists is Moses Tyson Jr. which has great technique and style. \r\n\r\nVallejo is a beautiful city and has a wide variety of people from all walks of life creating a well- rounded blend.
