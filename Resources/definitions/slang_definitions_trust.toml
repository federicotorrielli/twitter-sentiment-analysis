Males are the most common specimens found in pet stores, and are brightly colored with long fins.  Females, once nearly impossible to find by non-breeders, have been trickling into pet stores for sale, though at first glance female bettas may be mistaken for a completely different species of fish. Females are the same size as male betta, often lack the same bright colors and never have the large amount of finnage that males have.\r\n\r\nBettas do not require airation in their tanks. The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice [paddies] and ditches.  \r\n\r\nBettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high [protein diet] in order to survive.  Special betta food is needed for them to live, but to thrive they *need* to be fed on live foods, such as mosquito larvae, bloodworms, small [fruit flies], and fruit fly maggots.\r\n\r\nMales of this species are naturally competitive and agressive towards one another.  The fish are often fought for money in [Siam] and Vietnam, in tents set up for the purposes, rather like aquatic [cockfighting].\r\n\r\nBetta have an average lifespan of 2 years (24 months). From hatching to death."

Known since antiquity, 7-11 has become the world's foremost purveyor of toxically unhealthy processed food products. Also notable are the [frictionless] tile floors and the uniformly East Indian service staff.\r\n\r\n7-11 has been a recognized natural phenomenon since the dawn of recorded history.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the 7-11 was a natural evolution of the 7-10, a prehistoric herd animal. 7-10 were common when the entire [landmass] of Earth was concentrated into one [supercontinent], [Pangaea]. Herds of 7-10 freely roamed the continent, having only one natural predator - [the Chuck Norris]. The massive evolutionary strain induced by such a [formidable foe] necessitated a new evolutionary strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first 7-11 was created by a confluence of the superintelligent East Indians and a herd of 7-10. This new symbiotic strategy proved successful - so successful, in fact, that individual members could survive without the protection of the herd. 7-11 spread to every corner of the supercontinent before the famed breakup of Pangaea (actually caused by one of Chuck Norris' temper tantrums) and so were located around the planet when humans showed up some hundreds of millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 7-11 on humanity has been tremendous. Former hunter/gatherer societies, upon finding a cluster of 7-11, would settle there rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle. With the relief of the burden of constantly searching for food, humans were free to develop other primitive activities, such as religion and the killing of innocent people. It is at this point in history that we see the first evidence of Norris worship, including human sacrifice and execution by roundhouse kicking. The first cities developed around herds of 7-11, and wars were common between those who had access to 7-11 and those who did not have such privilege.\r\n"
