God, Bahá'u'lláh said, has set in motion historical forces that are [breaking down] traditional barriers of race, class, creed, and nation and that will, in time, give birth to a universal civilization. The principal challenge facing the peoples of the earth is to accept the fact of their [oneness] and to assist the processes of unification.\r\n\r\nOne of the purposes of the Bahá'í Faith is to help make this possible.
