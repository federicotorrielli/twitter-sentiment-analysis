amc = "American Motors Corportation - was created by the merger of the Hudson and Nash motor companies in 1953. At the time it was the biggest merger in US history. By 1960 both the Hudson and Nash names were phased out and the company product was known simply as \"[Rambler]\". By 1969 the Rambler name was phased out and all cars were simply known as AMC. \r\n\r\nAMC became famous for its line of enconomy cars, but made some critical mistakes that caused the company to lose  millions and be sold to Chrysler in 1986. The first one was [the Marlin], designed as [AMC's] answer to Ford's Mustang in 1964. But management decided to build it on a [large car] frame, which made it bigger and more expensive than the Mustang, and not as quick or economical for teenagers and young adults. [The Marlin] was a poor seller, but was a extremly good looking car and now very collectable. \r\n\r\nIn 1968 AMC rolled out [the Javelin], which was the best car AMC ever built. Sleek, sexy and powerful it gave the Mustang, Camero, Firebird, Charger and Barracuda a big run for thier money and at the [dragstrip]. It lasted until 1974 when it was dropped from the lineup and replaced the poor selling (and ugly) [Madador] coupe. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970's you could call AMC the \"Alternative Motor Company\" - they put out some of the strangest American cars ever built. The first one was the Gremlin, which was basically a AMC Hornet with the back cut off and replaced with a hatchback. With a [light body] it was a very quick, fun and responsive car, even with an [straight 6] motor. It was a fun ponycar challenger with the optional and rare V-8 option.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 AMC rolled out which must be the strangest car ever and the one they're known in pop culture history for - [The Pacer]. This car was as wide as a full size auto but as short as subcompact with lots of glass. Once you saw it, you never forgot it. The Pacer sold briskly in the mid 70's but sales fell off quickly by the late 70's when people became tired of the looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 AMC released The Eagle - essentully a AMC Hornet/Concord wagon with 4 wheel drive. Some car/truck historians say this was the first true SUV. It lasted until 1988.\r\n\r\nIn the early 80's AMC was almost bankrupt. The company had wasted most of its cash on [the Matador] Coupe and [Pacer] and had no money to upgrade its aging line of cars. A buyout from French automaker [Renault] proved disasterous for AMC with bad quality economy cars that sold poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing that was keeping AMC alive was its Jeep line, which they bought in the 1960's. In 1983 they downsised [the Cherokee], making it lighter and smaller. It became AMC's best selling product in the 1980's and remained in the lineup until 1991 when Chrysler replaced it with the [Jeep Liberty].\r\n\r\nIn 1986 Chrysler Corporation bought AMC.\r\n\r\nThe only things from the AMC legacy still around are the classic Jeep Wrangler, and it's legendary 4.0 \"power tech\" Straight-6. This is not a modern engine by any means. It was designed in 1964 for the AMC Rambler and still being made today in [Kenosha] WI at the original AMC factory, built in 1919!\r\n\r\nThough AMC is now history, the [marquee] is still fondly remembered by car collectors and fans.

The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice [paddies] and ditches.  \r\n\r\nBettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high [protein diet] in order to survive.

Kohls prides itself in a [yes we can]! policy i.e. if you bring a shirt to the register and say its 20 bucks but [on the register] it says the actual price is 30 they are supposed to give it to you for 20.

Continuing their [credit whore] policy it is common for a manager to go on the intercom and plea for customers to sign up for a credit card and describing the \"benefits\", these can last up to 3 minutes. Even though the sounds emitting over the intercom can sound like [nails on a chalkboard] some would argue that its a better then the atrocious music that plays such favorites as \"All in this Together\" - Ben LeeOne day on an 8 hour shift this song played a total of three times inducing nausea.Kohls attempts to justify their credit whoring by saying that it benefits everyone including employees because each employee receives a [meager] [stock option] after a year of employment and it will help increase that value;however, most employees don't even survive their 90 day training period let alone a year. An employee also only receives an increase of 50 cents to their paycheck for each credit card [whored]. The job pays bad especially in comparison to other similar retail establishments in the same class some even offer commission. Every Kohls is always understaffedgranted a lot of employees quit this shortage leads to a lack of customer service and a [pigpen] of a store. To add salt to the wound every week their is a customer service report card and the common complaint is lack of available associates, The managers then manipulate this [statistic] by putting the blame on employees saying they are not wearing their name badge or they don't smile and say hi to each customer. [Kohl's] does however offer cheap merchandise albeit at the expense of its employees so it is a good place to find a deal.[That being said] as an employee the workplace at Kohl's left me with a pessimistic outlook on life and since my termination from the company i feel like a changed individual.Oftentimes [work experience] will help you become a better worker but Kohls has managed to put me in a worse position then before i started.

In order to achieve entry into one of these places, one had to pay something called “money” (which was usually supplied through “making love” (a la hooker hippies) or “making drug deals” (a la drug dealing hippies/Chad))  One of the more interesting facets of the Drive-In Movie theatre was its methods of employing staff.  As work at a [drive-in] was deemed strenuous and unpleasant (even for drug-out hippies!!) theatres of this nature were often forced to hire from the “untouchable” caste of American society.  (This included ex-cons, street mimes, demented clowns, and certain types of super intelligent [marsupials].)  \r\nPeople used to have an abundant amount of sex at a drive-in.  This was due to the fact that, in the 1970s, it was thought that parents conceiving an infant during a drive-in feature would be granted immortality and a free [betamax] copy of [In Like Flint].  How this urban legend was started is unknown, but one would assume it had something to do with the massive amounts of LSD consumed by hippy stoners of the 1970s.  \r\n[Drive-in] movie theatres are now all gone, due mainly to the Hippy Massacre of 1986, which resulted in the genocide of many hippies, including Lance Armstrong’s [third cousin] “Larry Cletus Smokealotofpot”.  Also, employees of drive-ins often burned parts of their workplace to [cinders] while performing bizarre pagan rituals.  \r\nIn conclusion, [Joan Rivers] is hot and I would gladly have carnal relations with her [pruny] exoskeleton.\r\n"

Hamilton believed that the United States needed to reduce its dependence on foreign goods and should instead develop its own industries.\r\n\r\nThe industries developed in Paterson were powered by the 77-foot high [Great Falls] of the Passaic, and a system of water raceways that harnessed the power of [the falls]. The district originally included dozens of mill buildings and other manufacturing structures associated with the textile industry and later, the firearms, silk, and railroad [locomotive] manufacturing industries. In the latter half of the 1800's, silk production became the dominant industry and formed the basis of [Paterson's] most prosperous period, earning it the nickname \"[Silk City].\" Paterson was also the site of historic labor [unrest] that focused on anti-child labor legislation, safety in the workplace, a minimum wage, and reasonable working hours."

Still, cities like Yonkers, Mount Vernon, (parts of) New Rochelle and Peekskille are far more socioeconomically and racially diverse than the rest of the county and make up a substantial portion of its population,  "

Vallejo started mainly as a spanish and native american city, then grew intensely over the years.

For a city of approx. 450,000 people(Oakland, Ca) that would be approx. [204] murders which by far exceeds [Oakland's] highest homicide rate of [190]. Vallejo has  claimed by many to \"become the next \"Richmond\" or \"Oakland\" which it already has been, but has made dramatic improvements.  Many of the new residents of Vallejo do not know the history and cannot appreciate how far Vallejo has come.  It was the Oakland or the Richmond of it's day and has dramatically improved over the years to homicide rates of 3 per year with a population of over 120,000 people.  Other crimes such as thefts and burglaries are far above average, but overall the city has improved becoming a safer place to live.\r\n\r\nVallejo is the home of musicians: Sly and the [family Stone], Mac Dre, [E 40], [Mac Mall], [Turf Talk].\r\n\r\nVallejo is also the home for [Six Flags] Discovery Kingdom formerly known as Six Flags Marine World.  Vallejo is increasing in size, and the economy is growing, more jobs are created to keep more people off the streets.  \r\n\r\nVallejo is well known for the many churches it has, and is the backbone to gospel music in the Bay area along with Oakland, Ca.  Also performing here as one of the top organists is Moses Tyson Jr. which has great technique and style. \r\n\r\nVallejo is a beautiful city and has a wide variety of people from all walks of life creating a well- rounded blend.

This sequence is normally called a \"problem\". The [climber] is not [roped], and the only protection allowed is a thick [foam mattress] called \"crashpad\". [Bouldering] problems rarely go higher than 3 or 4 meters above the ground.\r\n\r\n \"Solving\" a problems often forces to make unlikely movements, like \"pinching\" a hold with your heels, or literally jumping from hold to hold (doing a \"[dyno]\"). Style is important, but what really counts is to reach the last hold (the \"top\")\r\n\r\nBouldering was developed in the 60's in France and in California (by [John Gill], the \"[human fly]\") as a pastime for bored rock climbers in off-season. In the 90's, however, the growth of indoor climbing walls (often homemade) and [rock climbing] gyms has made [bouldering] popular with the urban / hip-hop crowd, transforming it - in France and UK - in a \"signature\" sport like skateboarding. Part of the popularity of bouldering is due to  the fact that it's being quite cheap - the only thing you need is a pair of climbing shoes (and the crashpad if you're bouldering outdoor).\r\n\r\nThere's a lively competition circuit around the world, and there are now bouldering sites (often simple concrete walls) almost in every city of the world. In fact, bouldering is now more a  urban sport than an outdoor activity."
