The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air.

Also notable are the [frictionless] tile floors and the uniformly East Indian service staff.\r\n\r\n7-11 has been a recognized natural phenomenon since the dawn of recorded history.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the 7-11 was a natural evolution of the 7-10, a prehistoric herd animal. 7-10 were common when the entire [landmass] of Earth was concentrated into one [supercontinent], [Pangaea]. Herds of 7-10 freely roamed the continent, having only one natural predator - [the Chuck Norris]. The massive evolutionary strain induced by such a [formidable foe] necessitated a new evolutionary strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first 7-11 was created by a confluence of the superintelligent East Indians and a herd of 7-10. This new symbiotic strategy proved successful - so successful, in fact, that individual members could survive without the protection of the herd. 7-11 spread to every corner of the supercontinent before the famed breakup of Pangaea (actually caused by one of Chuck Norris' temper tantrums) and so were located around the planet when humans showed up some hundreds of millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 7-11 on humanity has been tremendous. Former hunter/gatherer societies, upon finding a cluster of 7-11, would settle there rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle. With the relief of the burden of constantly searching for food, humans were free to develop other primitive activities, such as religion and the killing of innocent people. It is at this point in history that we see the first evidence of Norris worship, including human sacrifice and execution by roundhouse kicking. The first cities developed around herds of 7-11, and wars were common between those who had access to 7-11 and those who did not have such privilege.\r\n"

In winter, Alpine, Nordic, and backcountry skiing & snowboarding and snowshoeing are available.  The Colorado Trail and the [Continental Divide] Trail transit the area, and there are many, many miles of other trails.  The area is am outdoor enthusiasts' dream, and it's still pretty cheap.  The vibe is really laid back and unpretentious.  People wear Tevas, Chaco, Keens, Patagonia, The North Face, [Mountain Hardwear], Royal Robbns, Marmot, etc. - to court or church.   Buena Vista is home to one of the original independent outdoor shops, The [Trailhead] and Trailhead Cycle & Ski.  They are small but very good and still one of the best outdoor shops - bar none - in the world.  The Trailhead is the best place to go for any information on outdoor activities, places to go, and anything you need from outdoor gear, clothes, stove fuel, bike parts, footwear, travel items (you name it) while you're in the area.  Locals and visitors all go there.  They can handle everything and everybody from hard-core dirtbag hikers and climbers to trustafarians to MountainSexuals to a trip to Europe."

Gasoline here is an average of [ten cents] higher than the entire midwestern united states. I once drove from Bloomington to Denver and didn't see gas any more expensive than in Bloomington.\r\n\r\nAlso, due to the large population of [collage] students, traffic is a nightmare during the school year, and it's always better to drive around the south side of town than to cut through campus. In the summer, the students leave, traffic subsides, and the residents timidly emerge from the shelter of their houses and go back to their lives.\r\n\r\nUnfortunatly, without collage students to worry about, the police department can focus all of their energy on going after residents, so don't expect to get away with anything while the students are gone.\r\n\r\nOverall, I reccomend it if you already live in Indiana and want to get the fuck out of some shithole like Gary, but [don't move] here from any other state."
