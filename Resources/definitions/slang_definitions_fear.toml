amc = "American Motors Corportation - was created by the merger of the Hudson and Nash motor companies in 1953. At the time it was the biggest merger in US history. By 1960 both the Hudson and Nash names were phased out and the company product was known simply as \"[Rambler]\". By 1969 the Rambler name was phased out and all cars were simply known as AMC. \r\n\r\nAMC became famous for its line of enconomy cars, but made some critical mistakes that caused the company to lose  millions and be sold to Chrysler in 1986. The first one was [the Marlin], designed as [AMC's] answer to Ford's Mustang in 1964. But management decided to build it on a [large car] frame, which made it bigger and more expensive than the Mustang, and not as quick or economical for teenagers and young adults. [The Marlin] was a poor seller, but was a extremly good looking car and now very collectable. \r\n\r\nIn 1968 AMC rolled out [the Javelin], which was the best car AMC ever built. Sleek, sexy and powerful it gave the Mustang, Camero, Firebird, Charger and Barracuda a big run for thier money and at the [dragstrip]. It lasted until 1974 when it was dropped from the lineup and replaced the poor selling (and ugly) [Madador] coupe. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970's you could call AMC the \"Alternative Motor Company\" - they put out some of the strangest American cars ever built. The first one was the Gremlin, which was basically a AMC Hornet with the back cut off and replaced with a hatchback. With a [light body] it was a very quick, fun and responsive car, even with an [straight 6] motor. It was a fun ponycar challenger with the optional and rare V-8 option.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 AMC rolled out which must be the strangest car ever and the one they're known in pop culture history for - [The Pacer]. This car was as wide as a full size auto but as short as subcompact with lots of glass. Once you saw it, you never forgot it. The Pacer sold briskly in the mid 70's but sales fell off quickly by the late 70's when people became tired of the looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 AMC released The Eagle - essentully a AMC Hornet/Concord wagon with 4 wheel drive. Some car/truck historians say this was the first true SUV. It lasted until 1988.\r\n\r\nIn the early 80's AMC was almost bankrupt. The company had wasted most of its cash on [the Matador] Coupe and [Pacer] and had no money to upgrade its aging line of cars. A buyout from French automaker [Renault] proved disasterous for AMC with bad quality economy cars that sold poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing that was keeping AMC alive was its Jeep line, which they bought in the 1960's. In 1983 they downsised [the Cherokee], making it lighter and smaller. It became AMC's best selling product in the 1980's and remained in the lineup until 1991 when Chrysler replaced it with the [Jeep Liberty].\r\n\r\nIn 1986 Chrysler Corporation bought AMC.\r\n\r\nThe only things from the AMC legacy still around are the classic Jeep Wrangler, and it's legendary 4.0 \"power tech\" Straight-6. This is not a modern engine by any means. It was designed in 1964 for the AMC Rambler and still being made today in [Kenosha] WI at the original AMC factory, built in 1919!\r\n\r\nThough AMC is now history, the [marquee] is still fondly remembered by car collectors and fans. Cars that were once considered \"junk\" have now become cool and highly collectable."

Vallejo started mainly as a spanish and native american city, then grew intensely over the years.  Now Vallejo in 2007 has a population of around 125, 000 people, with a wide variety of nationalities predominately:  White-30%, black 30%, asians 20% and hispanic(latino)-19%, others: native american, [pacific islander].\r\n\r\nVallejo has a great diversity of people from rich to poor, and is about 40% lower class(10% of them in poverty) 40% middle class 10% wealthy.  Some of the dangerous parts of the city are: [Millerville], South Vallejo, Country Club Crest, Downtown-west, [Hillcrest] area among many other small parts, this is where there are stronger concentrations of crime.  \r\n\r\nVallejo in 1987 at a population of 70,000 had 34 murders which was the record number for the city.  For a city of approx. 450,000 people(Oakland, Ca) that would be approx. [204] murders which by far exceeds [Oakland's] highest homicide rate of [190].

westchester = "mostly suburban county bordering the bronx to the south and fairfield county, ct to the north. largely perceived as a haven for wealthy investment bankers, lawyers and doctors who commute to and work in manhattan, westchester does indeed have more than its fair share of elite golf courses (think [winged foot]), high-end stores (gucci, louis vuitton etc) and country clubs.\r\n\r\nhowever, while one of the ten wealthiest counties in america, there is more to westchester than the popular public perception might suggest. herein lies a breakdown of westchester locales:\r\n\r\nPreppy and Rich- think Rye, [Bronxville] and [Larchmont]. You'll find the old-school clubs (Larchmont Yacht, Westchester Country Club) and preppier atmospheres in these towns.

These towns are a bit more status-obsessed than their preppy counterparts. Their school systems are among the highest-performing in the nation and they tend to attract many Jewish and Asian families that put a premium on their children's educations. Think of designer clothes behind the wheel of a mercedes sports car as opposed to a vineyard vines polo behind the wheel of a [jeeb] or volvo to understand the difference between preppy and [jappy] wealth.\r\n\r\nGuido Rich- Think Harrison, [Pelham] and parts of [New Rochelle]. Think gelled hair, Armani Exchange, fake tans and heavy make-up. Easy to confuse for imports from New Jersey.\r\n\r\nHollywood Rich- Much of the northern tier of the county, which is more rustic, appealing to celebrities seeking privacy. Bedford, [North Salem], Pound Ridge and others boast several celebrity residents.\r\n\r\nGhetto- The last type of community one would associate with Westchester. Still, cities like Yonkers, Mount Vernon, (parts of) New Rochelle and Peekskille are far more socioeconomically and racially diverse than the rest of the county and make up a substantial portion of its population,  "

In order to achieve entry into one of these places, one had to pay something called “money” (which was usually supplied through “making love” (a la hooker hippies) or “making drug deals” (a la drug dealing hippies/Chad))  One of the more interesting facets of the Drive-In Movie theatre was its methods of employing staff.  As work at a [drive-in] was deemed strenuous and unpleasant (even for drug-out hippies!!) theatres of this nature were often forced to hire from the “untouchable” caste of American society.  (This included ex-cons, street mimes, demented clowns, and certain types of super intelligent [marsupials].)  \r\nPeople used to have an abundant amount of sex at a drive-in.  This was due to the fact that, in the 1970s, it was thought that parents conceiving an infant during a drive-in feature would be granted immortality and a free [betamax] copy of [In Like Flint].  How this urban legend was started is unknown, but one would assume it had something to do with the massive amounts of LSD consumed by hippy stoners of the 1970s.  \r\n[Drive-in] movie theatres are now all gone, due mainly to the Hippy Massacre of 1986, which resulted in the genocide of many hippies, including Lance Armstrong’s [third cousin] “Larry Cletus Smokealotofpot”.  Also, employees of drive-ins often burned parts of their workplace to [cinders] while performing bizarre pagan rituals.  \r\nIn conclusion, [Joan Rivers] is hot and I would gladly have carnal relations with her [pruny] exoskeleton.\r\n"

Also notable are the [frictionless] tile floors and the uniformly East Indian service staff.\r\n\r\n7-11 has been a recognized natural phenomenon since the dawn of recorded history.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the 7-11 was a natural evolution of the 7-10, a prehistoric herd animal. 7-10 were common when the entire [landmass] of Earth was concentrated into one [supercontinent], [Pangaea]. Herds of 7-10 freely roamed the continent, having only one natural predator - [the Chuck Norris]. The massive evolutionary strain induced by such a [formidable foe] necessitated a new evolutionary strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first 7-11 was created by a confluence of the superintelligent East Indians and a herd of 7-10. This new symbiotic strategy proved successful - so successful, in fact, that individual members could survive without the protection of the herd. 7-11 spread to every corner of the supercontinent before the famed breakup of Pangaea (actually caused by one of Chuck Norris' temper tantrums) and so were located around the planet when humans showed up some hundreds of millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 7-11 on humanity has been tremendous. Former hunter/gatherer societies, upon finding a cluster of 7-11, would settle there rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle. With the relief of the burden of constantly searching for food, humans were free to develop other primitive activities, such as religion and the killing of innocent people. It is at this point in history that we see the first evidence of Norris worship, including human sacrifice and execution by roundhouse kicking. The first cities developed around herds of 7-11, and wars were common between those who had access to 7-11 and those who did not have such privilege.\r\n"

Evidence suggests that the clan also spread right across the Scottish Highlands as far as Dunkeld. Through emigration, either forced or voluntary, the name Ferguson and its rich heritage have travelled throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Fergusson or Ferguson, \"son of Fergus\" (MacFhearguis in Gaelic), is shrouded by the mists of time. Medieval historians recorded a tradition that the founder of Scotland's monarchy was a Fergus who lived in Ireland about 300 B.C. Traditions tell that by 500 A.D. the Scots under Fergus Mór mac Eirc had left Northern Ireland and became established in Dál Riata, now [Argyll]. From Fergus Mor, with a few early exceptions, descend all subsequent kings and queens of the Scots, including the present Queen of Britain. St. [Columba] of Iona (6th century A.D.) was a scion of Fergus [Mor's] royal line.\r\n\r\nAccording to Medieval historians Fergus was the founder of the Scottish monarchy. Ayrshire and [Dumfries] Fergussons alike claim descent from Fergus of [Galloway]. The grandfather of Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick and in turn [great-great-grandfather] to Robert Bruce, Fergus, restored the see of Whithorn and founded Dundrennan Abbey during the reign of David I and Malcolm IV. He died as a monk at Holyrood in 1161. Through Robert Bruce passes the line of the Royal Family of Britain. It was the 1st Earl of [Carrick's] signature that might suggest the origins of the Fergusson surname, Duncan, son of Gilbert, the son of Fergus, hence MacFhearguis."
