Known since antiquity, 7-11 has become the world's foremost purveyor of toxically unhealthy processed food products. Also notable are the [frictionless] tile floors and the uniformly East Indian service staff.\r\n\r\n7-11 has been a recognized natural phenomenon since the dawn of recorded history.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the 7-11 was a natural evolution of the 7-10, a prehistoric herd animal. 7-10 were common when the entire [landmass] of Earth was concentrated into one [supercontinent], [Pangaea]. Herds of 7-10 freely roamed the continent, having only one natural predator - [the Chuck Norris]. The massive evolutionary strain induced by such a [formidable foe] necessitated a new evolutionary strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first 7-11 was created by a confluence of the superintelligent East Indians and a herd of 7-10. This new symbiotic strategy proved successful - so successful, in fact, that individual members could survive without the protection of the herd. 7-11 spread to every corner of the supercontinent before the famed breakup of Pangaea (actually caused by one of Chuck Norris' temper tantrums) and so were located around the planet when humans showed up some hundreds of millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 7-11 on humanity has been tremendous. Former hunter/gatherer societies, upon finding a cluster of 7-11, would settle there rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle. With the relief of the burden of constantly searching for food, humans were free to develop other primitive activities, such as religion and the killing of innocent people. It is at this point in history that we see the first evidence of Norris worship, including human sacrifice and execution by roundhouse kicking. The first cities developed around herds of 7-11, and wars were common between those who had access to 7-11 and those who did not have such privilege.\r\n"

Michael handled the situation poorly as comedian. A good comedian will know how to shut up [hecklers] and make it funny for everyone. \r\n\r\nMichael acknowledges that what he said was wrong and if anyone saw his [apology video] on Letterman, you could see that he was sincere in his apology and is most definately not racist. We all have the potential to let our emotions get to us and even [spew out] garbage like what Richards said at the laugh factory under certain circumstances even though we may not mean it. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, this whole issue has brought up a slew of idiots. First are the closet-racists who are saying Richards had the right to call them \"niggers\" because he was being heckled and called cracker (even though the \"victims\" called him that after the tirade). Nigger is a derogatory term that goes back in the slavery days although today can be taken as other meanings. Despite this fact, it was clear that the way [Richard's] used it was in a derogatory sense. The second group of idiots this has brought up is Jesse Jackson and [Al Sharpton]. It's not bad enough they called for a boycott on the new Seinfeld DVD but also to sop using the word \"nigger\" altogether?? These are the kind of people increasing racial tension in our society and what's more sickening is that some people actually follow these guys as if they're Malcolm X or Martin Luther King. "
