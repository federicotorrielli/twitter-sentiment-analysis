amc = "American Motors Corportation - was created by the merger of the Hudson and Nash motor companies in 1953. At the time it was the biggest merger in US history. By 1960 both the Hudson and Nash names were phased out and the company product was known simply as \"[Rambler]\". By 1969 the Rambler name was phased out and all cars were simply known as AMC. \r\n\r\nAMC became famous for its line of enconomy cars, but made some critical mistakes that caused the company to lose  millions and be sold to Chrysler in 1986. The first one was [the Marlin], designed as [AMC's] answer to Ford's Mustang in 1964. But management decided to build it on a [large car] frame, which made it bigger and more expensive than the Mustang, and not as quick or economical for teenagers and young adults. [The Marlin] was a poor seller, but was a extremly good looking car and now very collectable. \r\n\r\nIn 1968 AMC rolled out [the Javelin], which was the best car AMC ever built. Sleek, sexy and powerful it gave the Mustang, Camero, Firebird, Charger and Barracuda a big run for thier money and at the [dragstrip]. It lasted until 1974 when it was dropped from the lineup and replaced the poor selling (and ugly) [Madador] coupe. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970's you could call AMC the \"Alternative Motor Company\" - they put out some of the strangest American cars ever built. The first one was the Gremlin, which was basically a AMC Hornet with the back cut off and replaced with a hatchback. With a [light body] it was a very quick, fun and responsive car, even with an [straight 6] motor. It was a fun ponycar challenger with the optional and rare V-8 option.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 AMC rolled out which must be the strangest car ever and the one they're known in pop culture history for - [The Pacer]. This car was as wide as a full size auto but as short as subcompact with lots of glass. Once you saw it, you never forgot it. The Pacer sold briskly in the mid 70's but sales fell off quickly by the late 70's when people became tired of the looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 AMC released The Eagle - essentully a AMC Hornet/Concord wagon with 4 wheel drive. Some car/truck historians say this was the first true SUV. It lasted until 1988.\r\n\r\nIn the early 80's AMC was almost bankrupt. The company had wasted most of its cash on [the Matador] Coupe and [Pacer] and had no money to upgrade its aging line of cars. A buyout from French automaker [Renault] proved disasterous for AMC with bad quality economy cars that sold poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing that was keeping AMC alive was its Jeep line, which they bought in the 1960's. In 1983 they downsised [the Cherokee], making it lighter and smaller. It became AMC's best selling product in the 1980's and remained in the lineup until 1991 when Chrysler replaced it with the [Jeep Liberty].\r\n\r\nIn 1986 Chrysler Corporation bought AMC.\r\n\r\nThe only things from the AMC legacy still around are the classic Jeep Wrangler, and it's legendary 4.0 \"power tech\" Straight-6. This is not a modern engine by any means. It was designed in 1964 for the AMC Rambler and still being made today in [Kenosha] WI at the original AMC factory, built in 1919!\r\n\r\nThough AMC is now history, the [marquee] is still fondly remembered by car collectors and fans. Cars that were once considered \"junk\" have now become cool and highly collectable."

Known since antiquity, 7-11 has become the world's foremost purveyor of toxically unhealthy processed food products. Also notable are the [frictionless] tile floors and the uniformly East Indian service staff.\r\n\r\n7-11 has been a recognized natural phenomenon since the dawn of recorded history.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the 7-11 was a natural evolution of the 7-10, a prehistoric herd animal. 7-10 were common when the entire [landmass] of Earth was concentrated into one [supercontinent], [Pangaea]. Herds of 7-10 freely roamed the continent, having only one natural predator - [the Chuck Norris]. The massive evolutionary strain induced by such a [formidable foe] necessitated a new evolutionary strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first 7-11 was created by a confluence of the superintelligent East Indians and a herd of 7-10. This new symbiotic strategy proved successful - so successful, in fact, that individual members could survive without the protection of the herd. 7-11 spread to every corner of the supercontinent before the famed breakup of Pangaea (actually caused by one of Chuck Norris' temper tantrums) and so were located around the planet when humans showed up some hundreds of millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 7-11 on humanity has been tremendous. Former hunter/gatherer societies, upon finding a cluster of 7-11, would settle there rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle. With the relief of the burden of constantly searching for food, humans were free to develop other primitive activities, such as religion and the killing of innocent people. It is at this point in history that we see the first evidence of Norris worship, including human sacrifice and execution by roundhouse kicking. The first cities developed around herds of 7-11, and wars were common between those who had access to 7-11 and those who did not have such privilege.\r\n"

kohls = "An establishment located in plazas and sometimes traditional malls. Mr.[Kohl] \"pioneered\" a method where the registers are at the front like a grocery store but since then this technique has ineffective because current management believes that having only one worker on the registers is sufficient. Because of their lack of insight this leads to a constant \"[barrage] of backup to mens!\", \"backup to womans!\", \"There is no line at jewelry!\",etc over the [intercom].Most of the time even despite the lack of workers at [the register] the reason for the hold up at the register is because of the employees who participate in long drawn out conversations with customers about the great \"deals\" they have. The main reason  for the delays at the register, however; is due to the company's credit policy. Each Manager is bred and trained into credit \"whores\" where their main existence is to bully and [pester] customers into signing up for credit cards where they charge a fee of 20% if your late on your payment.$100, you pay $120. If the customer says [no they don't] want a credit card in the manual an employee supposed to say, \"Are you sure you have an opportunity to save up to 12 times a year\" and if that doesn't work in a desperation move an employee is then supposed to ask if they would like to sign up for an email account. Kohls prides itself in a [yes we can]! policy i.e. if you bring a shirt to the register and say its 20 bucks but [on the register] it says the actual price is 30 they are supposed to give it to you for 20. Actually because the people working at the registers believe they have some divine duty to not give anyone a deal add to the increased barrage of people on the intercom by calling for employees to see if that is the actual price. Continuing their [credit whore] policy it is common for a manager to go on the intercom and plea for customers to sign up for a credit card and describing the \"benefits\", these can last up to 3 minutes. Even though the sounds emitting over the intercom can sound like [nails on a chalkboard] some would argue that its a better then the atrocious music that plays such favorites as \"All in this Together\" - Ben LeeOne day on an 8 hour shift this song played a total of three times inducing nausea.Kohls attempts to justify their credit whoring by saying that it benefits everyone including employees because each employee receives a [meager] [stock option] after a year of employment and it will help increase that value;however, most employees don't even survive their 90 day training period let alone a year. An employee also only receives an increase of 50 cents to their paycheck for each credit card [whored]. The job pays bad especially in comparison to other similar retail establishments in the same class some even offer commission. Every Kohls is always understaffedgranted a lot of employees quit this shortage leads to a lack of customer service and a [pigpen] of a store. To add salt to the wound every week their is a customer service report card and the common complaint is lack of available associates, The managers then manipulate this [statistic] by putting the blame on employees saying they are not wearing their name badge or they don't smile and say hi to each customer. [Kohl's] does however offer cheap merchandise albeit at the expense of its employees so it is a good place to find a deal.[That being said] as an employee the workplace at Kohl's left me with a pessimistic outlook on life and since my termination from the company i feel like a changed individual.Oftentimes [work experience] will help you become a better worker but Kohls has managed to put me in a worse position then before i started.

ferguson = "The name Ferguson (or Fergusson) and its history spreads from Argyle and Kintyre on the west coast of Scotland (then known as Dál [Riata]), but also as far across as [Antrim] in northeastern Ireland under [Fergus] Mór mac Eirc. Evidence suggests that the clan also spread right across the Scottish Highlands as far as Dunkeld. Through emigration, either forced or voluntary, the name Ferguson and its rich heritage have travelled throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Fergusson or Ferguson, \"son of Fergus\" (MacFhearguis in Gaelic), is shrouded by the mists of time. Medieval historians recorded a tradition that the founder of Scotland's monarchy was a Fergus who lived in Ireland about 300 B.C. Traditions tell that by 500 A.D. the Scots under Fergus Mór mac Eirc had left Northern Ireland and became established in Dál Riata, now [Argyll]. From Fergus Mor, with a few early exceptions, descend all subsequent kings and queens of the Scots, including the present Queen of Britain. St. [Columba] of Iona (6th century A.D.) was a scion of Fergus [Mor's] royal line.\r\n\r\nAccording to Medieval historians Fergus was the founder of the Scottish monarchy. Ayrshire and [Dumfries] Fergussons alike claim descent from Fergus of [Galloway]. The grandfather of Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick and in turn [great-great-grandfather] to Robert Bruce, Fergus, restored the see of Whithorn and founded Dundrennan Abbey during the reign of David I and Malcolm IV. He died as a monk at Holyrood in 1161. Through Robert Bruce passes the line of the Royal Family of Britain. It was the 1st Earl of [Carrick's] signature that might suggest the origins of the Fergusson surname, Duncan, son of Gilbert, the son of Fergus, hence MacFhearguis."

It is filled with overly-rich people who have so much money that they don't know what to do with it, so they buy a third house (their second in [Sherwood]). Your summers from when you’re a little toddler to a 16-year old boy/girl consist of going to a day camp. When you were [little you] were horribly scared of the Great White Ape and believed all the stories about kids being torn apart or eaten. Every kid can't wait until their Senior year, but once it's finally there they are all ready for camp to be over. To all the Seniors, assassin is the best game they have ever played. In this camp, you look up to God (AKA Mr. [Moulden]) and live to see him drive around on a [golf cart] with speakers blaring off the back. The [Highland Games] are your life and the [Waterman] Games are even better. Most likely you wear a one [piece up] until your senior year, when you realize that you should probably [lay out] at Main Pier and get a tan. While the boys play roof ball, you listen to your I-pods and repeatedly play the same songs. You wouldn't miss Trophy Night for anything and you know that the Romans usually always win, but [the Spartans] are still “just as good”! Every kid's dream is to be Boy or Girl of the Year, but only one prevails. Absolutely no girls shave and someone should probably inform them that swimming in the seaweed-infested [Severn] River does not count as showering. Everyone is open and says exactly what’s on their minds even if it is, \"Safety. I farted.\" You use the term [mexi] regularly, referring to seating three across a golf cart, and if someone doesn’t know what it means they are automatically in the back. There is never any drama because everyone realizes that people aren't perfect. You can always count on 40-year old men (most of them relatively attractive) to play basketball every Sunday morning shirtless. Married/Singles baseball is [kind of a big deal] around here and the [In-School]/Out of School Lacrosse game is eagerly anticipated every year. The friendships that are made here are stronger than any other bond between a group of people. If you live there, you know what “the gully” means and almost every night you end up drinking (or passing out!) there. Every year you have a different \"hot spot\" that eventually gets busted, but you continue to go back their anyways. You know the security guard’s name and cell phone number by heart and all the tricky ways to stay out of his way. Corn roast and the third of July are your favorite holidays and both are just reasons for all the alcoholics to get shit faced and tell funny stories the next morning. On both of these nights, no matter what your age, everyone parties together. Sixteen year-olds drink with 40 year-olds and are told, \"Whatever happens on the road stays on the road.\" On [the fourth of July], [Mr. Kraft] (who you also worship) drives around a truck with a band playing in the back, followed by all the hung-over counselors and then the entire community decked out in red, white, and blue! To people who live here, 30 is not a number it’s a beverage. You know what shave ball is and cannot wait until you’re 21 so you can go to The [Flatts] and join in. Almost everyone has \"borrowed\" atleast one golf cart, but some people are not able to return it and have to serve community service..cough,cough. Almost everyone moves back to this community when they are older and have a family of their own here. Everyone in the relatively close [Annapolis] area makes fun of this neighborhood, but secretly all wish they lived here. But to everyone who lives there [it’s there] own little paradise, no place they’d rather be.."
