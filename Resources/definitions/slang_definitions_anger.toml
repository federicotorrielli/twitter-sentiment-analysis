Females are the same size as male betta, often lack the same bright colors and never have the large amount of finnage that males have.\r\n\r\nBettas do not require airation in their tanks. The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice [paddies] and ditches.  \r\n\r\nBettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high [protein diet] in order to survive.

The fish are often fought for money in [Siam] and Vietnam, in tents set up for the purposes, rather like aquatic [cockfighting].\r\n\r\nBetta have an average lifespan of 2 years (24 months).

Because of quattro, many Audis are owned in northern climates where their driving joys can be enjoyed all year round.  Audi interiors are the [benchmark] that other companies attempt to match.

amc = "American Motors Corportation - was created by the merger of the Hudson and Nash motor companies in 1953. At the time it was the biggest merger in US history. By 1960 both the Hudson and Nash names were phased out and the company product was known simply as \"[Rambler]\". By 1969 the Rambler name was phased out and all cars were simply known as AMC. \r\n\r\nAMC became famous for its line of enconomy cars, but made some critical mistakes that caused the company to lose  millions and be sold to Chrysler in 1986. The first one was [the Marlin], designed as [AMC's] answer to Ford's Mustang in 1964. But management decided to build it on a [large car] frame, which made it bigger and more expensive than the Mustang, and not as quick or economical for teenagers and young adults. [The Marlin] was a poor seller, but was a extremly good looking car and now very collectable. \r\n\r\nIn 1968 AMC rolled out [the Javelin], which was the best car AMC ever built. Sleek, sexy and powerful it gave the Mustang, Camero, Firebird, Charger and Barracuda a big run for thier money and at the [dragstrip]. It lasted until 1974 when it was dropped from the lineup and replaced the poor selling (and ugly) [Madador] coupe. \r\n\r\nIn the 1970's you could call AMC the \"Alternative Motor Company\" - they put out some of the strangest American cars ever built. The first one was the Gremlin, which was basically a AMC Hornet with the back cut off and replaced with a hatchback. With a [light body] it was a very quick, fun and responsive car, even with an [straight 6] motor. It was a fun ponycar challenger with the optional and rare V-8 option.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 AMC rolled out which must be the strangest car ever and the one they're known in pop culture history for - [The Pacer]. This car was as wide as a full size auto but as short as subcompact with lots of glass. Once you saw it, you never forgot it. The Pacer sold briskly in the mid 70's but sales fell off quickly by the late 70's when people became tired of the looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 AMC released The Eagle - essentully a AMC Hornet/Concord wagon with 4 wheel drive. Some car/truck historians say this was the first true SUV. It lasted until 1988.\r\n\r\nIn the early 80's AMC was almost bankrupt. The company had wasted most of its cash on [the Matador] Coupe and [Pacer] and had no money to upgrade its aging line of cars. A buyout from French automaker [Renault] proved disasterous for AMC with bad quality economy cars that sold poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing that was keeping AMC alive was its Jeep line, which they bought in the 1960's. In 1983 they downsised [the Cherokee], making it lighter and smaller. It became AMC's best selling product in the 1980's and remained in the lineup until 1991 when Chrysler replaced it with the [Jeep Liberty].\r\n\r\nIn 1986 Chrysler Corporation bought AMC.\r\n\r\nThe only things from the AMC legacy still around are the classic Jeep Wrangler, and it's legendary 4.0 \"power tech\" Straight-6. This is not a modern engine by any means. It was designed in 1964 for the AMC Rambler and still being made today in [Kenosha] WI at the original AMC factory, built in 1919!\r\n\r\nThough AMC is now history, the [marquee] is still fondly remembered by car collectors and fans. Cars that were once considered \"junk\" have now become cool and highly collectable."

Every kid can't wait until their Senior year, but once it's finally there they are all ready for camp to be over. To all the Seniors, assassin is the best game they have ever played. In this camp, you look up to God (AKA Mr. [Moulden]) and live to see him drive around on a [golf cart] with speakers blaring off the back.

Corn roast and the third of July are your favorite holidays and both are just reasons for all the alcoholics to get shit faced and tell funny stories the next morning.

To people who live here, 30 is not a number it’s a beverage. You know what shave ball is and cannot wait until you’re 21 so you can go to The [Flatts] and join in. Almost everyone has \"borrowed\" atleast one golf cart, but some people are not able to return it and have to serve community service..cough,cough.

[XML] is commonly used for [interfacing] with SOA services, though this is not required.\n\nService-orientation requires loose [coupling] of services with operating systems, and other technologies that underlie applications. SOA separates functions into distinct units, or services, which developers make accessible over a network in order to allow users to combine and reuse them in the production of applications. These services and their corresponding consumers communicate with each other by passing data in a well-defined, shared format, or by [coordinating] an activity between two or more services."

In the U.S., the practice can be traced back to chattel slavery, when violence among slaves was a property crime with potentially draconian consequences. [Verbal sparring] became a substitute for physical contention. While the competition on its face is usually light-hearted, smiles sometimes mask real tensions.\r\n\r\nThe dozens can be a harmless game, or, if tempers flare, a prelude to physical violence. But in its purest form, the dozens is part of an African-American custom of [verbal sparring], of \"[woofin']\" (see [wolf ticket]) and \"[signifyin'],\" intended to defuse conflict amicably, descended from an oral tradition rooted in traditional West African cultures. The dozens is a contest of personal power -- of wit, self-control, verbal ability, mental agility and mental toughness. Defeat can be humiliating; but a skilled contender, win or lose, may gain respect.\r\n\r\n\"Yo' mama,\" a common, widely recognized argumentative rejoinder in African-Amercan vernacular speech, is a cryptic reference to the dozens.\r\n\r\nThe term \"the dozens\" refers to the devaluing on the auctionblock of slaves who were past their prime, who were aged or who, after years of back-breaking toil, no longer were capable of hard labor. These enslaved human beings often were sold by the dozen.\r\n\r\n(My wording from Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia.)"

Herds of 7-10 freely roamed the continent, having only one natural predator - [the Chuck Norris]. The massive evolutionary strain induced by such a [formidable foe] necessitated a new evolutionary strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first 7-11 was created by a confluence of the superintelligent East Indians and a herd of 7-10. This new symbiotic strategy proved successful - so successful, in fact, that individual members could survive without the protection of the herd. 7-11 spread to every corner of the supercontinent before the famed breakup of Pangaea (actually caused by one of Chuck Norris' temper tantrums) and so were located around the planet when humans showed up some hundreds of millions of years later.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 7-11 on humanity has been tremendous. Former hunter/gatherer societies, upon finding a cluster of 7-11, would settle there rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle. With the relief of the burden of constantly searching for food, humans were free to develop other primitive activities, such as religion and the killing of innocent people. It is at this point in history that we see the first evidence of Norris worship, including human sacrifice and execution by roundhouse kicking. The first cities developed around herds of 7-11, and wars were common between those who had access to 7-11 and those who did not have such privilege.\r\n"

Evidence suggests that the clan also spread right across the Scottish Highlands as far as Dunkeld. Through emigration, either forced or voluntary, the name Ferguson and its rich heritage have travelled throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Fergusson or Ferguson, \"son of Fergus\" (MacFhearguis in Gaelic), is shrouded by the mists of time. Medieval historians recorded a tradition that the founder of Scotland's monarchy was a Fergus who lived in Ireland about 300 B.C. Traditions tell that by 500 A.D. the Scots under Fergus Mór mac Eirc had left Northern Ireland and became established in Dál Riata, now [Argyll]. From Fergus Mor, with a few early exceptions, descend all subsequent kings and queens of the Scots, including the present Queen of Britain. St. [Columba] of Iona (6th century A.D.) was a scion of Fergus [Mor's] royal line.\r\n\r\nAccording to Medieval historians Fergus was the founder of the Scottish monarchy. Ayrshire and [Dumfries] Fergussons alike claim descent from Fergus of [Galloway]. The grandfather of Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick and in turn [great-great-grandfather] to Robert Bruce, Fergus, restored the see of Whithorn and founded Dundrennan Abbey during the reign of David I and Malcolm IV. He died as a monk at Holyrood in 1161. Through Robert Bruce passes the line of the Royal Family of Britain. It was the 1st Earl of [Carrick's] signature that might suggest the origins of the Fergusson surname, Duncan, son of Gilbert, the son of Fergus, hence MacFhearguis."

Other crimes such as thefts and burglaries are far above average, but overall the city has improved becoming a safer place to live.\r\n\r\nVallejo is the home of musicians: Sly and the [family Stone], Mac Dre, [E 40], [Mac Mall], [Turf Talk].\r\n\r\nVallejo is also the home for [Six Flags] Discovery Kingdom formerly known as Six Flags Marine World.

montclair = "Commuter suburb in [Essex County], NJ, about 15 miles from Manhattan. Divided into about three sections. [Section 1]: The \"ghetto\" of southeastern and east central Montclair, mostly composed of vaguely derelict multifamily houses and vacant laundromats, and black with a few Sikhs in population. Known as an infamous drug trading area for everyone in suburban Essex County. The area between [Glenfield] Park and [Glen Ridge] Avenue is typically considered the worst area, where over 1/2 the businesses are vacant and most of the houses appear to be in a state of disrepair. It is also home to [Lackawanna] Plaza, a discount shopping center. Black people have lived in the area south of [Bloomfield] Avenue in East Montclair since the 1700s, and the area north of Bloomfield Avenue is originally a very old Italian neighborhood that is now primarily black, but with some Sikhs. 2. Downtown Montclair-An expanding area centered on the fairly trendy business area around Bloomfield Avenue, Church Street, Fullerton Avenue, Midland Avenue, and Walnut Street. [This is home] to many boutiques, restaurants, [art house] movie theaters, bookstores, galleries, and a disordinate number of antique stores for such a small town. The residential areas of Downtown Montclair range from primarily white luxury apartments and restored Victorian two-family houses off Bloomfield Avenue to multimillion dollar houses near Essex Park and down South Mountain Avenue towards the Eagle Rock Reservation. Upper Mountain Avenue in the vicinity of Downtown Montclair is the home of the wealthiest part of Upper Mountain Avenue, which offers multimillion dollar mansions and NYC views, and is arguably the most exclusive street in suburban Essex County. Downtown Montclair has spawned a breed of white rich kids who think of themselves as the hippest, hottest thing in the universe. Most of the people who are Downtown Montclair users are either yuppies, part of an expat community of twenty, thirty, and fortysomethings from NYC, or bored, self-absorbed teenagers. Downtown Montclair also includes most of Claremont Avenue, a somewhat dangerous and deserted residential boulevard. Home of [Montclair High School], infamous as home of racial rioting and rich white indie kids. 3. Upper Montclair-The very, very wealthy, totally white and primarily residential area north of [Watchung] Avenue. Known as the home of private high schools like Lacordaire Academy and [Montclair Kimberley Academy], both used by Upper Montclair residents and residents from towns to the west. Upper Montclair is very middle-aged white and [teenagery] and totally boring and quaint. The main business strip is Valley Road, [seconded] by Watchung Avenue. People from Downtown Montclair view it as the epitome of the rich white people who they think they aren't, even though Upper Montclair people do happen to be sheltered, obnoxious, and when not old money, act like they're old money. Montclair is, finally, known for the attitude of thinking itself diverse (by the white people) but being, in actuality, totally segregated, even among the black people. The wealthier blacks live towards [West Orange] while the poorest towards Glenfield Park. It's an ideal example of the hypocritical secret racism by white liberals on a smaller scale, as opposed to the occurence in NYC, which is on too large a scale to thoroughly socially examine."
