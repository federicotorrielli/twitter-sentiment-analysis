Males are the most common specimens found in pet stores, and are brightly colored with long fins.  Females, once nearly impossible to find by non-breeders, have been trickling into pet stores for sale, though at first glance female bettas may be mistaken for a completely different species of fish. Females are the same size as male betta, often lack the same bright colors and never have the large amount of finnage that males have.\r\n\r\nBettas do not require airation in their tanks. The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice [paddies] and ditches.  \r\n\r\nBettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high [protein diet] in order to survive.

The fish are often fought for money in [Siam] and Vietnam, in tents set up for the purposes, rather like aquatic [cockfighting].\r\n\r\nBetta have an average lifespan of 2 years (24 months).

I once drove from Bloomington to Denver and didn't see gas any more expensive than in Bloomington.\r\n\r\nAlso, due to the large population of [collage] students, traffic is a nightmare during the school year, and it's always better to drive around the south side of town than to cut through campus. In the summer, the students leave, traffic subsides, and the residents timidly emerge from the shelter of their houses and go back to their lives.\r\n\r\nUnfortunatly, without collage students to worry about, the police department can focus all of their energy on going after residents, so don't expect to get away with anything while the students are gone.\r\n\r\nOverall, I reccomend it if you already live in Indiana and want to get the fuck out of some shithole like Gary, but [don't move] here from any other state."
