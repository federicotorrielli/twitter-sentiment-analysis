Males are the most common specimens found in pet stores, and are brightly colored with long fins.

Females are the same size as male betta, often lack the same bright colors and never have the large amount of finnage that males have.\r\n\r\nBettas do not require airation in their tanks. The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice [paddies] and ditches.  \r\n\r\nBettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high [protein diet] in order to survive.  Special betta food is needed for them to live, but to thrive they *need* to be fed on live foods, such as mosquito larvae, bloodworms, small [fruit flies], and fruit fly maggots.\r\n\r\nMales of this species are naturally competitive and agressive towards one another.  The fish are often fought for money in [Siam] and Vietnam, in tents set up for the purposes, rather like aquatic [cockfighting].\r\n\r\nBetta have an average lifespan of 2 years (24 months).
